Title: Web-Based Cadastral Database (Final Project)

Description:

This repository hosts the code for my final school project: a real-time, interactive web-based cadastral database. This open-source application, built with MongoDB, Next.js, and Mapbox, allows users to efficiently visualize, manage, and query cadastral data.

Key Features:

Interactive Map Interface:

Visualize cadastral parcels on a customizable Mapbox map, seamlessly panning, zooming, and interacting with data overlays.
Search and filter parcels based on various criteria (e.g., owner name, parcel number, location).
View detailed parcel information within pop-ups or dedicated panels.
Seamless Data Management:

Add, edit, and delete cadastral records within the intuitive web interface.
Manage complex data structures with ease thanks to MongoDB's flexibility.
Ensure data integrity and security through comprehensive access control and validation.
User-Friendly Interface:

Navigate the application with ease using Next.js's efficient server-side rendering and routing.
Enjoy a responsive and accessible design that adapts to different screen sizes and user needs.
Customize the interface to your specific project requirements and workflows.
Technologies:

Frontend: Next.js
Database: MongoDB
Mapping API: Mapbox
Other open-source tools: [ tailwindcss]
Motivation:

This project aims to modernlize the storing of casadral data  by providing a user-friendly and reliable tool for cadastral data management. By utilizing open-source technologies, I strive to contribute to the accessibility and transparency of information within this domain.

Future Development:

Integration with additional data sources for enriched property information.
Advanced search and filtering capabilities based on spatial and temporal attributes.
User roles and permissions management for enhanced security and collaboration.
I welcome contributions and suggestions from the community! Please feel free to fork this repository, report issues, and share your ideas to make this project even better.
